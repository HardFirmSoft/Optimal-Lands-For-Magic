# Optimal-Lands-For-Magic
This code finds the optimal number of lands for a 60 card Magic the Gathering deck.
Spoiler: Its 17
It takes the assumption that the optimal number of lands is 4 after 5 turns.
It works by simulating the first 5 turns of play many times, with varying numbers of lands.
It calculates and optimizes the probablity of having the optimal number of lands.
